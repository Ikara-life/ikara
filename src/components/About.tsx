                  Ikara was born from a simple insight: modern life is overstimulating and
                  undernourishing. We're a group of makers, wellness seekers, and nature lovers
                  reimagining what it means to live and work â€” with balance, intention, and clarity.

              Our story began with a simple question: What if we could create a space where people
